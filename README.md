# IPL-Match-Win-Predictor

Based on the first innings performance of a team, this app takes in current data of second innings and tries to predict the win probability of either of the teams.

Below are the steps followed in the model preparation:

### Data Collection: 
The first step is to collect the required data. In this case, the data is obtained from the Kaggle dataset, which contains information about IPL matches, including the first innings performance and the final result.

### Data Preprocessing: 
Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed to prepare it for analysis. This involves tasks like handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

### Feature Engineering: 
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the performance of the machine learning models. For example, you may create features like run rate, required run rate, and wickets remaining based on the available data.

### Splitting the Data: 
The preprocessed data is then split into two parts: a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the machine learning models, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the models.

### Model Training: 
Next, machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and random forest are applied to train models on the training data. These algorithms learn patterns and relationships in the data and create models that can be used for prediction.

### Model Evaluation: 
The trained models are evaluated using the testing set to assess their performance. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The models that perform well are selected for further use.

### Model Deployment: 
Once the best-performing model is selected, it can be deployed using a framework like Streamlit. Streamlit allows you to create interactive web applications easily, where users can input the current data of the second innings, and the deployed model can predict the win probability of each team based on the first innings performance.

Overall, the app collects IPL data, preprocesses and transforms it, trains machine learning models on the preprocessed data, evaluates their performance, and finally deploys the best model using Streamlit for easy user interaction and win probability prediction in real-time.
